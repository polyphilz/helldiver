# Helldiver

Helldiver is a lightweight command-line program written in Python that converts your Markdown files into blog-aware HTML. It's designed for blogs with the most minimal of features (think: a date when the post was written, *maybe* an author, and nothing more).

Essentially, you can turn this:

```
2/29/2020%Tim Smith%

# Sample Post Title

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis 
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

![alt text](../sample-assets/google-logo.png "Logo Title Text")
```

Into this:

```
<h1 class="post-title">
 Sample Post Title
</h1>
<p class="post-date">
 February 29th, 2020
</p>
<p class="post-author">
 Tim Smith
</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis 
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">
 <img alt="alt text" class="post-img" src="../sample-assets/google-logo.png" title="Logo Title Text"/>
</p>
```

## Features

Helldiver allows you to:

- Optionally specify a date and/or an author in your Markdown that will be included in the generated HTML
- Add CSS classes to generated HTML tags

## Installation

Install Helldiver in 3 steps:

1. Install the package from PyPI
2. Add the program to your PATH
3. Grant executable rights

### Installing the package from PyPI

Helldiver is built and packaged using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). It requires Python 3.7 and can be installed simply using `pip`:

`pip install helldiver`

### Adding Helldiver to your PATH

You can then add it to your PATH for ease-of-use. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

`export PATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/helldiver:$PATH"`

Don't forget to source with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`. If you get an error from that, it could be because `pip` installed `helldiver` in a different location than what's written in the command above. `pip` generally installs packages to a folder called `site-packages`, but you can confirm `helldiver`'s location with:

`pip show helldiver | grep Location | sed 's/Location: //'`

Example output of above command: `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`

### Grant executable rights

Run `chmod +x /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/helldiver/helldiver.py` to allow the program to be run.

## Usage

There are two components to using Helldiver:

1. Adding a header line to your Markdown files that contain date/author information
2. Running the program with the required flags

### Working with your Markdown

Helldiver uses the `%` character as a sentinel value, in between which you would place the desired date and author information. For example, at the top of your Markdown file, if you add the following line:

```
02/29/2020%Tim Smith%

# My title for my post

... content ...
```

The date and author retrieved will be `02/29/2020` and `Tim Smith` respectively.

Don't want to put a date, an author or either of them? That's completely okay, just leave the corresponding area in the header blank:

No date, no author: `%%`

Date, but no author: `2/29/2020%%`

Author, but no date: `%Tim Smith%`

### Running the program

`helldiver.py` takes 3 required flags and 1 optional flag:

#### Required flags

- `-f` or `--filename`: The file name of the Markdown file you want to convert
- `-m` or `--markdown`: The file path to the directory containing the above Markdown file
- `-ht` or `--html`: The file path to the directory you would like generated HTML to be placed in

#### Optional flags

- `-c` or `--classes`: The class names you would like generated HTML elements to have. The format is `... -c h1=post-title h2=post-heading img=post-img` and so on. Provide as many or as little HTML tags as desired. Please ensure that you don't write `h1 = post-title`; this will be interpreted as 3 different flag values (h1, =, post-title)
- `-hr` or `--hrule`: A boolean indicating whether you would like to add an `<hr>` tag after your title, author and/or date. Ex: `... -hr True`. Leave the flag out if you don't want the tag.

For example, given the following directory structure:
  
```
.
|--- ...
|--- writing
|    |--- markdown
|         |--- sample-post.md
|     
|         
|--- ...
```

When I run: `helldiver.py -f sample-post -m writing/markdown/ -ht writing/`, I would expect a `sample-post.html` to be added to the `writing` directory:

```
.
|--- ...
|--- writing
|    |--- markdown
|    |    |--- sample-post.md
|    |---sample-post.html 
|         
|--- ...
```

Please keep in mind that both directories that store Markdown and HTML files must exist to begin with.

## Known Issues

Be careful when using locally-stored images in your Markdown. If the directories that contain your Markdown and generated HTML aren't at the same level in the directory hierarchy, then the `src` attribute in the generated HTML won't correctly link to the image. This will have to be manually changed for now.

## Why Another "Static Site Generator"?

It's true, there are existing (and amazing) projects like [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) that act as full-suite static site generators. As lightweight as they are though, even they were too "feature-complete" for my use case when I was building [my own personal website](https://github.com/rbnsl/personal-website). I needed something simple to make my Markdown blog-ready and wanted to have some fun in the process; thus, Helldiver was born.
